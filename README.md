# The Salamanca Project
Salamanca is a 2D rpg - fantasy - action videogame. Set in the early 1400, a documentary team
and their guide (5 People) are dragued to the past while visiting a small town in
Argentina. There, while fillming and inspecting a cave, they discover a strange altar and a
bright light fills the room rendering them unconcious. Upon waking thy find themselves in strange
places. Separated and lost their journey toward survival beggins. Guide their skills and choices 
and discover all off their posible endings.

The development will have 3 main focuses, the story, game mechanics and optimization, so the
game can be enjoyed on almost any PC (And later any plataform).

 - The story will be centered around the pre - colombine comunities their relation with nature,
 spirits, the great profecy, and the corruption. Full with references to myth creatures of the
 south american imaginary and local fauna. The player depending on their character selection
 will be able to join any of the 3 forces in the story and take offencive actions on all others.

 - Game mechanics:

   * Combat: 
     + Movement will stop momentarly when performing any action for all creatures, save for
     certain character which will be able to perform distance basic atacks while moving but
     will have to collect ammo (max storage 1 - 6) during battle.
     + Save for special equipment or creatures, no damage will be recived or done upon contact
     with creatures or players.
     + There will be 3 types of phisical damage: Piercing, slashing and blunt damage. Each can
     be dealth by weapons or actions of NPC.
     + There will be 6 types of elemental damage such as: Fire, water, poison, light, corruption
     electrical and sand (if properly used). This will be mostly achived through the use of
     items, nature and 1 spell used by a single character.
     + There is magic though it will be able to cause only the folowing tipes of damage: All
     phisical types of damage and poison. A lone spell alows player to control creatures fully
     corrupted during battle.
     + Each of the Playable Characters (PaC) will count with a unique combat skill tree with 15 
     active skills and 10 pasive skills.
     + Through special atacks or by strong atacks of certain creatures the player can suffer
     the following impairment states: Broken Bone on a body part (Arm, legs, chest, spine and
     head), entanglement, blindness, deafening, poisoning, corruption, burning and bleading.
     Save for broken spine and head most states can be: Either healed in battle with action
     (entanglement) items (blindness, poisoning, bleading), damage (fire damage has a small
     chance to cauterize a bleading wound) and time(deafening). Or outside combat through the
     aplication of splints + ointments + time broken bones can be healed. Bleading can be
     stoped with the aplication of bandages + ointments outside combat. Burning can be stoped
     by throwing onself on a body of water or by covering onself with a special blanket (Both
     inside and ouside combat). Corruption can be healed in 3 ways, by consulting with a
     native elder shaman, a colonist priest or by aplicating an ointment while performing a
     ritual of self purification outside combat (Unlockable skill).


   * Stats

     + PaC's have 3 types of stats: Primary, Secondary, Lore. Primary stats recive a bonus for every Lvl up, and a important bonus every 10 Lvls. Stats points will be given that can be asigned before saving. 1 for every Lvl and 2 for every 10Lvls. Secondary stats cannot be modified by the player directly, they are influenced by primary and lore stats, equipment, buffs and skills. Lore Stats can be trained or modified by the player choices.

     + Character Primary Stats:
       1. Strength: This stat will affect the damage a character can inflict either barehanded, with throwables impact or with weapons. It also influences the weapons that can be wielded efectibly, equiping weapons that can't be handled due to heaviness will lead to realy low damage blows. \n
       2. Constitution: This stat afects health, poison resistance, phisical resistance, stamina, hunger and thirst.
       3. Dexterity: This will afect damage for close range weapons, CQC Skills, and aim range for ranged weapons. Also afects critical strike chances
       4. Inteligence: This influences the ability to retain and understand lore. It also influences the correct use of elements for combat, increasing elemental damge and critical strikes chances.
       5. Wisdom: Afects the way a character can understand other creatures feelings, providing access to lore and taming. A lot of wisdom betters the chances of a character to increase it's spiritual affinity, but may result on rejection from certain NPC's.
       6. Charisma: Afects the chances to recive better rewards or access to certain lore and quests. Can generate jealousy hence bloking access to certain quests.

     + Character Lore Stats:
       1. Morality: Desperation or greed can lead to moraly deranged choices. The questions are "how far are you willing to go?" and "will you be able to stop?". Afects spiritual, and corruption afinity. Can triguer certain quests on all communities.
       2. Perception: The more an isue, the enviroment or people are stuided the more strange things may be noticed. Influences the chance to notice traps, to gather lore or quests, and survivavilty skills. You might find that some things are better left unfound...
       3. Spiritual Affinity: Nature voice could be heard loud and strong in older days, with right mentality and masters, you might be able to hear it too. Increases corruption resistance, taming chance, access to some quests and special items.
       4. Theological Affinity: The words of the lord has reached new lands, and those willing to hear it can be found anywhere. Hearing and imparting those words can heal and guide the lost souls. Remember though, there is only one lord of the heavens. Can unlock certain quests and access to special items. This affinity lowers taming chance on all creatures.
       5. Corruption Affinity: Not all paths can be found within nature, and skill is needed to transit the places where light cannot reach. Sometimes, sacrifices must be made to move foward, can you handle the gilt? This affinity allows access to some quests, some tamings and shady/creapy shops.
       6. Fears: Only by facing onself and moving foward can a person be called coragious. Can you surpass that which scares you or will you freeze at it's mere sight? only time will tell. Constant debuff when fighting certain creatures or circumstances. Can be changed into buffs by completing unique quests.
       7. Encoragements: Fighting by your lonesome can be cool, but friends only make you stronger. Buffs the player when fighting near allies or tamed creatures, can turn into a debuff if allies die before you.

     + Lore, wisdom, perseption, moralty, fame and time can affect the choices avaliable for
     the player, events and quests that can be found and compleated. (This is more a personal
     wish than a promise. I sincerly don't know if my programing skills can achive this or
     ever will).

   * Inventory
     + Unless you have certain cat's dimentional pocket, I highly doubt you can carry an infinite amount of items, so pack wisely traveler.
     + Clothes with pockets can hold small items in small quantyties and some supplys.
     + Doble layering is allowed and will improve armor, but will affect movement and atack speed
     + The way to greatly expand the item inventory is with pouches, backpacks, pushcarts and husbandry (Equiping a horse with a backpack). They come in diferent sizes and purposes but not all can be used everywhere.
     
   * Survivability and Combat Skill Trees
     + All PaC shares the same survival skill tree.
     + Survival skills will be atained by performing certain actions on diferent enviroments
     and situations. Or by paying a teacher to learn it and improve it (Be aware of scams)
     And shared skill trees for survival
     + Creating and filling a log book can improve chances of learning or upgrading survival
     skills.

    * Lore
      + Lore can be obtained through N diferent ways: Collecting scrolls and copying tablets or certain
      stones and walls, with some survival skills through studing diferent things, talking with diferents
      NPC's, buying books, or decyphering natives mesages.
      + PaC can retain a good amount of lore by memory (Some more than others) but only by creating/obtaining
      and updating a log book can all lore be stored and freely accesible.
      + Forgeting to update a log book on time or either not having it soon enough can cause some lore to be
      lost and permanently unatainable.
      + Intelligence and wisdom stat can affect the amount of lore that can be obtained from the same
      sources.
    
    * Questing
      + A main quest will be avaliable to all PaC as the story develops and compleating it will show one of
      the posible endings for the characters based on achivements and decitions made during the game.
      + Community quests: All communities will have a main quest that will be asigned to the players by the
      elders, capitains and the void. Achiving this quest milestones can afect aspects of the main quest, 
      prices of stores or better bartering options, less restrictions on activities on certain areas, far
      better chances at adquiring that community lore and hence adquiring side quests.
      + Side Quests: These will be avaliable on all communities for all PaC but not all can be recived
      depending on the character fame with that community.
      
    * Community perseption (Fame)
      + Will show the player their social status with each community and the benefits of those relations.
      + Might be a good idea to focus on just one though, choose wisely adventurer...
    
    * Saving
      + Game saves can be done in 4 diferent ways: At the moment one achieves a main quest or community quests milestones. By performing one of the community rituals at midnight a game can be saved.
 
 - Optimization
   * Game graphics can be fun to play around with but we can't forget this moto: "To be played by anybody, graphics are secondary and fun is eternal", so they can and will be sacrificed if a low end gaming plataform can't execute the game in a playable state. Of coursr only after throwing all performance trics first so that it can be run.
   * Game should be able to run optimaly on both original release plataforms (Windows and Linux)
   * All stages of the game will be separated and tested and afterwards tested in conjuction (Including dungeons). If no bugs are detected for the full game, and ONLY THEN, a release date will be anounced and a marketing campain will be lunched.
   * These maxims mast be upholded for all games developed by this studio (Fun in Plain Sight).
