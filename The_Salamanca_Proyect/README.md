Salamanca is a 2D rpg - fantasy - action videogame. Set in the early 1400, a documentary team
and their guide (5 People) are dragued to the past while visiting a small town in
Argentina. There, while fillming and inspecting a cave, they discover a strange altar and a
bright light fills the room rendering them unconcious. Upon waking thy find themselves in strange
places. Separated and lost their journey toward survival beggins. Guide their skills and choices 
and discover all off their posible endings.

The development will have 3 main focuses, the story, game mechanics and optimization, so the
game can be enjoyed on almost any PC (And later any plataform).

 - The story will be centered around the pre - colombine comunities ther relation with nature,
 spirits, the great profecy, and the corruption. Full with references to myth creatures of the
 south american imaginary and local fauna. The player depending on their character selection
 will be able to join any of the 3 forces in the story and take ofencive actions on all others.

 - Game mechanics:

   * Combat: 
     + Movement will stop momentarly when performing any action for all creatures, save for
     certain character which will be able to perform distance basic attacks while moving but
     will have to collect ammo (max storage 1 - 6) during battle.
     + Save for special equipment or creatures, no damage will be recived or done upon contact
     with creatures or players.
     + There will be 3 types of phisical damage: Piercing, slashing and blunt damage. Each can
     be dealth by weapons or actions of NPC.
     + There will be 6 types of elemental damage such as: Fire, water, poison, light, corruption
     electrical and sand (if properly used). This will be mostly achived through the use of
     items, nature and 1 spell used by a single character.
     + There is magic though it will be able to cause only the folowing tipes of damage: All
     phisical types of damage and poison. A lone spell alows player to control creatures fully
     corrupted during battle.
     + Each of the Playable Characters (PaC) will count with a unique combat skill tree with 15 
     active skills and 10 pasive skills.
     + Through special attacks or by strong attacks of certain creatures the player can suffer
     the following impairment states: Broken Bone on a body part (Arm, legs, chest, spine and
     head), entanglement, blindness, deafening, poisoning, corruption, burning and bleading.
     Save for broken spine and head most states can be: Either healed in battle with action
     (entanglement) items (blindness, poisoning, bleading), damage (fire damage has a small
     chance to cauterize a bleading wound) and time(deafening). Or outside combat through the
     aplication of splints + ointments + time broken bones can be healed. Bleading can be
     stoped with the aplication of bandages + ointments outside combat. Burning can be stoped
     by throwing onself on a body of water or by covering onself with a special blanket (Both
     inside and ouside combat). Corruption can be healed in 3 ways, by consulting with a
     native elder shaman, a colonist priest or by aplicating an ointment while performing a
     ritual of self purification outside combat (Unlockable skill).


   * Stats and Inventory

     + Lore, wisdom, perseption, moralty, fame and time can affect the choices avaliable for the player,
     events and quests that can be found and compleated. (This is more a personal wish than a promise.
     I sincerly don't know if my programing skills can achive this or ever will).
     
   * Survivability
     + All PaC shares the same survival skill tree.
     + Survival skills will be atained by performing certain actions on diferent enviroments
     and situations. Or by paying a teacher to learn it and improve it (Be aware of scams)
     And shared skill trees for survival
     + Creating and filling a log book can improve chances of learning or upgrading survival
     skills.
     + The skills are as follows:
       _Botany
       _Fishing
       _Hunting
       _Alchemy
       _Navigation
       _Cooking
       _Adaptability
     + 4 PaC start with at least 1 survival skill on lvl 3, cooking, adaptability and navigation on lvl 1.
     And the last character will start with a special survival skill tree.

    * Lore
      + Lore can be obtained through N diferent ways: Collecting scrolls and copying tablets or certain
      stones and walls, with some survival skills through studing diferent things, talking with diferents
      NPC's, buying books, or decyphering natives mesages.
      + PaC can retain a good amount of lore by memory (Some more than others) but only by creating/obtaining
      and updating a log book can all lore be stored and freely accesible.
      + Forgeting to update a log book on time or either not having it soon enough can cause some lore to be
      lost and permanently unatainable.
      + Intelligence and wisdom stat can affect the amount of lore that can be obtained from the same
      sources.
    
    * Questing
    
    * Community perseption

    That last one only upgradable by completing quests or helping members of their selected/asigned allied comunity.
